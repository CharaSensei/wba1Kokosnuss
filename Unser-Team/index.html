                <p>I am Portuguese but relocated to Iceland about five years ago. I fell in love with diving here in Iceland. For the last three years, however, I have been going between Iceland and Thailand for a perfect mix of diving locations. In addition
                    to all water sports, I love traveling, reading, yoga, animals, and music.</p>

                <p>I have been diving since 1999 and became both a BSAC and PADI instructor in 2008/9 in the murky waters of the UK. I have a BSc in Hospitality and Tourism Management and before joining the DIVE.IS team in summer 2011 I ran a marine conservation
                    project in the Bahamas. I am passionate marine conservationist as i love the variety of life that can be found in our oceans, and feel like we should be doing everything in our power to protect it!

                    Courage is not the absence of fear, But rather the judgement that there is something more important than fear. The brave may not live for ever, but the cautious do not live at all.

                <p>I was born and raised in Canada but have been hiding from the cold for the last 5 years on sailboats in Australia and luxury resorts in Oman I have decided to go back to a climate where shorts don't exist. I am happiest either in the mountains
                    or in the water and finally found a place with easy access to both. Just don't ask me to pronounce anything in Icelandic eh.
